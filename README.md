# 🛒 Online Shopping System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **C++ simulation of an online shopping system**.  
It demonstrates the core functionalities of an e-commerce platform including **user management, product catalog, shopping cart, orders, payments, wishlist, and reviews**.

The system is modular, with separate classes for each component (e.g., `User`, `Seller`, `Buyer`, `Product`, `Order`, `Cart`, `Payment`, `Review`).  
It is designed to help understand **object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts** such as **inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.
